The article about the growth mindset talks about two different ways people 
can approach learning, their relationships and other aspects of their lives.  
On the one hand, you can believe that things like intelligence and personality 
traits are static.  Or you can believe that they are dynamic and changeable.  
The latter seems to lead to a more successful approach to work, school, 
relationships, etc.

The growth mindset can help me to be successful in this class by 
helping me to focus on the idea that even though I will encounter many 
challenges in this class, they can be overcome.  I will make mistakes but I 
can learn from them.  Effort is more important than what I perceive to be 
innate intelligence. In order to grow and learn, I have to push myself to do 
things that may be uncomfortable or difficult for me.  Success or failure is 
not pre-determined. In the end, I am the creator of my success.
